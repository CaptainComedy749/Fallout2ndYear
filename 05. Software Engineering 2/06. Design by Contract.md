### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Introduction</mark>

- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Design by Contract (DbC</mark>) or Programming by Contract is an approach to designing software.
- It says that designers should define precise and verifiable interface specifications for software components, with the use of preconditions, postconditions and invariants. These specifications are referred to as "contracts"; in the same way as a business contract entails certain obligations and conditions.
	- developed by Bertrand Meyer, “Bubbles (aka UML boxes) don’t crash”, and forms a central feature of Eiffel
	- uses <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">assertions</mark> – assertion is a Boolean statement that should never be false. If so, it indicates a bug
	- assertions usually only checked during debugging/testing
	
	- <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Three kinds of assertions:</mark>
		- post-conditions
		- pre-conditions
		- invariants
		
	- pre-conditions and post- conditions are associated with operations
	
### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Pre-condition:</mark>

- expresses something about the state of a program that should be true before an operation is executed
- e.g. a pre-condition for an integer-square-root operation might be 
- ``input >= 0``
- indicates it is an error to invoke square-root on a negative number
- e.g. ``pop()`` should net be called on an empty stack, precondition is
- ``s.isEmpty() == false``
- makes explicit that the calling routine is responsible for ensuring that something is true before operation is invoked
- lack of one may lead to too little or too much checking (duplicate checking code and thus more complicated program)
- 
### <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">Post Condition:</mark>

- a statement of what things should be like after the execution of an operation
- e.g. <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">integer-square-root</mark> operation
- ``result * result <= input < (result+1)*(result+1)``
- expresses <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">what</mark> an operation does rather than <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">how</mark> it does it
- separates implementation from interface
- leads to a stronger definition of an <mark style="background: #69E7E4;">exception</mark>. Exception occurs when an operation is invoked with its pre-condition satisfied and is unable to return with its post-condition true
