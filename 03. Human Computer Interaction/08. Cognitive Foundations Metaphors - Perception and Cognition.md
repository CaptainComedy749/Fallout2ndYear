### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">The User:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/A8kXcsl.png)

The user is the most important entity of the system

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">The Nature of the User:</mark>

- There are many categories of users and it is impossible to consider all of them.
- Can you group users?
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/4375fTw.png)

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Computer Skills and Knowledge:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Nondiscretionary Users:</mark>
- The computer is part of employment  
- Time and effort in learning to use computer are willingly invested  
- A high motivation is often used to overcome low usability characteristics 
- E.G. Flight Reservations Clerk, Programmer, etc.
- TU Dublin Students are non-discretionary users of Brightspace

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Discretionary Users:</mark>
- Are more self-directed, not told how to work 
- It is the result, not the means that are more important  
- Utilisation of the system is not necessary  
- Will not invest extra effort to use the system  
- Do not often show high motivation to use the system  
- Are easily disenchanted

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Impact on Interface Design:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Nondiscretionary:</mark>
- Productivity is the most important factor  
- Interface is still important, but the user will be willing to invest time and money for training  
- Niche application area, one type of user

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Discretionary:</mark>
- Interface is extremely important, first impression of the system  
- Must cater for many different user types  
- Must sell your product to user  
- If system is not perceived as achieving results with minimum effort, may be refused

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Novice Users:</mark>
- System features should assist recognition memory - menus, prompts, help screen  
- Need restricted vocabularies, simple tasks, small number of possibilities and information feedback  
- View practice as an aid to moving up to expert status

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Expert Users:</mark>
- Rely upon free recall  
- Need less information feedback  
- Seek efficiency by bypassing novice memory aids, reducing keystrokes and summarising   information

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Age:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Young User:</mark>
- Active learners drawing on physical and social experiences 
- Learn by doing  
- Require something that they can see, touch and hear  
- Prior to the age of 8, children rely on visual and auditory perception for knowledge  
- Learning is through first hand experience

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Young User Design Guidelines (Wyeth & Purchase, 2003):</mark>
- Activities are open-ended and discovery-oriented  
- Interaction encourages child-initiated play  
- Involve active manipulation and transformation of real materials  
- Entry-level knowledge and skill is kept to a minimum  
- Provision is made for children’s varied skill and ability levels 
- Construction activities that involve design, creation and evaluation processes form the basis of interactions

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Aging User:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/ULSfu91.png)

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Aging User Design Guidelines (Hawthorn, 2003):</mark>
- Simplify screen design  
- Provide users with simple linear search spaces with few options  
- Increase size of fonts and controls  
- Reduce both windows management tasks and scrolling  
- Ensure contrast between text and background  
- Menus can introduce problems, toolbars may be an alternative

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Culture:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cultural and International Diversity:</mark>
- Characters, numerals, special characters, and diacritical's (those that distinguish meanings)  
- Left-to-right versus right-to-left, versus vertical input and reading  
- Date and time formats  
- Numeric and currency formats  
- Weights and measures  
- Telephone numbers and addresses  
- Names and titles (Mr., Ms., Mme.)
- Social-security (USA), national identification (some EU), and passport numbers  
- Capitalisation and punctuation  
- Sorting sequences  
- Icons, buttons, colours  
- Pluralisation, grammar, spelling  
- Etiquette, policies, tone, formality, metaphors

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Disabilities:</mark>

Designers must plan early to accommodate users with disabilities.  

Their needs are more critical.  

Disabled users can be categorised as follows:  
- Physically disabled users  
- Cognitively disabled users

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Physically Disabled:</mark>

Impairments can include lack of mobility, low vision, blind and hearing...  

Alternative channels of interactions:  
- Speech recognition  
- Tune recognition  
- Lip-reading  
- Body-electric sensors  

The more sophisticated and complex a system is, the more specialised its target  group gets.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Physically Disabled Design Guidelines (Nielsen, 1995):</mark>

Provide keyboard access to application features  

Follow key-mapping guidelines or the local environment  

Avoid placing frequently used functions deep in a menu structure  

Do not hard-code colours, graphics, or font sizes and styles  

Provide visual information that is redundant with audible information  

Allow users to configure frequency and volume of audible cues

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitively Disabled:</mark>

Examples of cognitive impairments would be learning disabilities, dyslexia and poor memory.  

Changes can be made to accommodate these users by improving layouts, controlling vocabulary, and limiting short-term memory demand.

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitively Disabled Design Guidelines (Lewis, 2004):</mark>
- Social inclusion is most important  
- Access to information is critical to social inclusion and increasingly reliant on technology  
- Some research shows that these users have the same problems with web-sites as other users but with greater severity  
- Access to textual information is difficult

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Human Considerations:</mark>

A vital foundation for HCI designers is an understanding of <mark style="background: #BABD00;">cognitive</mark> and <mark style="background: #BABD00;">perceptual</mark> abilities of the user. 

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognition</mark> is what goes on in our heads when we carry out everyday activities.  

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive</mark> and <mark style="background: #BABD00;">perceptual abilities</mark>:  

The human ability to interpret sensory input rapidly and to initiate complex actions makes modern computer systems possible.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes:</mark>

![](https://i.imgur.com/WaFii5i.png)

The journal, Ergonomics Abstracts offers this classification of human cognitive processes:
- Long-term and semantic memory  
- Short-term and working memory  
- Problem solving and reasoning  
- Decision making and risk assessment  
- Language communication and comprehension  
- Search, imagery, and sensory memory  
- Learning, skill development, knowledge acquisition and concept attainment

The variety of cognitive attributes have an important influence on screen design.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Cognitive Processes - Perception:</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Perception</mark> is fundamental to interacting with computers.  

To use a computer, a user needs to perceive information that is presented by the interface.  

Perception can involve all the different senses (visual, hearing, touch, smell...)  

To date, HCI is mostly concerned with visual perception, because the computer screen is usually the interface.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WoJkepP.png)

Two classes of <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Visual Perception Theory</mark> are:
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive</mark>  
- <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Ecological</mark>

<mark style="background: #BABD00;">Constructive perception:</mark>
- Anything perceived on a screen is also a result of our prior knowledge and expectations
- Constructivism uses <mark style="background: #BABD00;">context</mark> to interpret and understand what we perceive when we see something.  
- This principle is not initially concerned with specific detail, it relates more to the overall meaning of the scene. That is, it might ‘generalise’ to interpret.

### <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Gestalt Laws:</mark>

Visual constructive perception relate to the <mark style="background: #BABD00;">Gestalt Laws of Perceptual Organisation</mark>.

(Gestalt = shape, and usually a shape made from more that one part).  ‘Laws’ of perception that are regarded as being innate:
- Proximity  
- Similarity  
- Closure  
- Continuity  
- Symmetry
